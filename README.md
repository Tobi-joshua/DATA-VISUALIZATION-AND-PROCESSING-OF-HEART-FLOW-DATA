# DATA-VISUALIZATION-AND-PROCESSING-OF-HEART-FLOW-DATA
This program is designed to analyze the effect of exercise on the function of the heart. It reads flow data from an MRI of blood flow out of patientsâ€™ left ventricle (LV) and analyzes the data to learn about how diseased hearts respond to the increased load experienced during exercise. The program first plots the flow measurements vs. times, then smooths the plot to reduce noise. It finds peaks and troughs in the data, divides up the flow data into separate cardiac cycles using the troughs, and plots the smoothed flow data with the locations of the starting points of the heartbeats. The program then computes the area under the flow data points for each heartbeat, calculates the mean and standard deviation of the areas of all heartbeats, and displays these values. Finally, the program plots a histogram of the areas under the flow data points for all heartbeats.
